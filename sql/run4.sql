You can do a git fetch at any time to update your remote-tracking branches under refs/remotes/<remote>/.
This operation never changes any of your own local branches under refs/heads, and is safe to do without
changing your working copy. I have even heard of people running git fetch periodically in a cron job in

local branch up-to-date with its remote version, while also updating your other remote-tracking branches.', 14);

your branches, you may run into frequent conflicts.', 15);

you use merge.', 16);

then commit it back to the server. The assumption is that the client can always contact the server when it needs
to perform an operation.', 17);

You can do a git fetch at any time to update your remote-tracking branches under refs/remotes/<remote>/.
This operation never changes any of your own local branches under refs/heads, and is safe to do without
changing your working copy. I have even heard of people running git fetch periodically in a cron job in

you use merge.', 79);

then commit it back to the server. The assumption is that the client can always contact the server when it needs
